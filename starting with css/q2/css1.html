                CSS rules are the instructions that tell the browser how to style the HTML elements on a web page. CSS rules consist of two main parts: a selector and a declaration block. A selector is a pattern that matches one or more HTML elements, such as a tag name, a class name, an id, or a combination of them. A declaration block is a set of properties and values that define the appearance or behavior of the selected elements, such as color, font, size, position, or animation. A declaration block is enclosed by curly braces and contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons. Each declaration consists of a property name and a value, separated by a colon. For example, the following CSS rule selects all paragraphs (&ltp&gt) on the web page and sets their text color to red and their text alignment to center:
            <br> &#123
                color: red;
                text-align: center;
                &#125
        </p>
